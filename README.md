# asteroidsSegaGenesis

This Game is a work in progress I'm taking a break for a little bit to work on something else. Everything has been written in C the only exception being the assembly in the ROM header. The code is reasonably efficient and I'm happy with the performance.

List of Features that still need to be added:
4 player vs or cooperative mode using Sega Team Player
Sound effects
Explosion Animations (Still not sure how I want to do those)
Menu and Settings screens
Level progression 2, 3, 4 and then it will just be level 4 repeated

Stretch Goals:
Possibly adding multiple game mode types
